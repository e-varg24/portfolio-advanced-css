# Advanced CSS: Portfolio

Discription

This weeks chalange was about us using what we learned the first week with the basic html and css and the advanced css to creat our portfolio. We had to have build a page that was similar to the mock page but with our own style. We had to have a place for our work, contacts and a bout me section.

Process

I started of with the html and built my page layout. Once i had my html all done i was able to build my css. I took a while to build the css and had to google alot of things and how to lay them out in place.

What i learned

I learned alot from this challenge espacialy that you have to go through a trail and erro stage to get your page to look like you want it. There is multiple ways to get your page layout looking the same with defront inputs.
